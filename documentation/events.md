# Event driven solution
# Intro
The solution is based around events, where you can use these events to trigger automations. All events contain relevant data, e.g. the mean price for the time slot starting.
the attribute mean_price is used for all events, regardless if it's a one hour slot or a multiple hour slot starting or ending.

```
event_type: start_expensive_energy_3h
data:
  mean_price: 249.8
origin: LOCAL
time_fired: "2023-01-27T18:00:00.031815+00:00"

# List of events
## Consecutive time slots
Some workloads, like a dish washer, need consecutive time slots to work; you need 3 hours "in a row", you cannot take 3 separate hours that are spread out in the day.
This first set of events are calculated within a single day (00-24)

| Slot | Start                         | End                         |
|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1h   | start_cheapest_electricity_1h | end_cheapest_electricity_1h |
| 2h   | start_cheapest_electricity_2h | end_cheapest_electricity_2h |
| 3h   | start_cheapest_electricity_3h | end_cheapest_electricity_3h |    
| 4h   | start_cheapest_electricity_4h | end_cheapest_electricity_4h |    
| 5h   | start_cheapest_electricity_5h | end_cheapest_electricity_5h |    


| Slot | Start                          | End                          |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 1h   | start_expensive_electricity_1h | end_expensive_electricity_1h |
| 2h   | start_expensive_electricity_2h | end_expensive_electricity_2h |
| 3h   | start_expensive_electricity_3h | end_expensive_electricity_3h |    
| 4h   | start_expensive_electricity_4h | end_expensive_electricity_4h |    
| 5h   | start_expensive_electricity_5h | end_expensive_electricity_5h |    

## Single 1 hour time slots for today
Some workloads will be just fine with separate hours even if they are spread out, for instance if you need 3 hours to charge your bike, you'd subscribe to the three first in the list. They could happen to be consecutive or they could be spread out and it would not impact the result; you'd still havea fully charged bike when the last hour has ended.
This first set of events are calculated within a single day (00-24)

## Single 1 hour time slots for today, one set for the morning and one set for the afternoon/evening
These set of events are calculated within a single day (00-12 and 12-24)

| Slot | Start                                          | End                                          |

## Single 1 hour time slots for evening-/night (20-08)
This  set of events are calculated for two days (20-08). These are not avaiable until the Nordpool sensor is updated with the values for the next day, which normally is aronud 13:00.

| Slot | Start                                               | End                                               |

You'll find some examples in the ha_energy/examples folder how to use these events for your own needs.
